# ToDoKiosk
This is the Rust version of ToDoKiosk that was originally written in Python using the Django web framework. The application was originally made in response to the lack of a web-based CalDAV tasks client. The application is made for showing tasks on a monitor on the side of a bookshelf near my desk to display current tasks on a CalDAV server.

## Requirements

- Compiling: Rust 1.76 or later
